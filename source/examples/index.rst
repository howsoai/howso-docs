Examples
========

Use these Jupyter Notebook examples as "recipes" for building your own use-cases!

1. :download:`Howso Engine Intro <https://github.com/howsoai/howso-engine-recipes/blob/main/1-engine-intro.ipynb>`
    - Learn the basics of our powerful engine in a traditional ML workflow!
2. :download:`Interpretability <https://github.com/howsoai/howso-engine-recipes/blob/main/2-interpretability.ipynb>`
    - See what really sets us apart with our suite of explainability tools! Use this example to find the factors that lead to a decision in your model.
3. :download:`Anomaly Detection <https://github.com/howsoai/howso-engine-recipes/blob/main/3-anomaly_detection.ipynb>`
    - Build your fraud and rare-events use-cases from this example using `Surprisal`!
4. :download:`Audit Edit <https://github.com/howsoai/howso-engine-recipes/blob/main/4-audit_edit.ipynb>`
    - Have you ever spent hours training a fine-tuned model only to have to retrain it with new data? Use this example to edit your trainee with no extra training needed!
5. :download:`Bias Mitigation <https://github.com/howsoai/howso-engine-recipes/blob/main/5-bias_mitigation.ipynb>`
    - Does your historical data contain bias such as men making more money than women? In traditional ML, this pattern will be used for any future predictions. Learn how to mitigate these biases in this example!
6. :download:`Validation <https://github.com/howsoai/howso-engine-recipes/blob/main/6-validation.ipynb>`
    - You may have noticed we don't use the traditional ML approach of `train-test-split <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html>`_ in our example workflows. There are use-cases, especially in small datasets, where a user cannot afford to further cut their data away from training the model. Use this example as proof for why train-test-splits are no longer needed when using Howso |tmk| !

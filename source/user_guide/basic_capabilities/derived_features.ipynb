    "Derived Features\n",
    "================\n",
    ".. topic:: What is covered in this user guide\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this guide, you will learn the basics of derived features.  These features are not predicted or\n",
    "    generated directly, but are instead derived using the supplied code and values from other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives: what you will take away\n",
    "-----------------------------------\n",
    "- **Definitions & Understanding** of how derived features work and how they can be used to accomplish novel\n",
    "  tasks for both time-series and non time-series tasks\n",
    "- **How-To** use derived features in and out of time-series workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "Prerequisites: before you begin\n",
    "-------------------------------\n",
    "- You have successfully :doc:`installed Howso Engine <../../getting_started/installing>`\n",
    "- You have :doc:`loaded, configured, trained, and analyzed data <basic_workflow>`\n",

    "Concepts & Terminology\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "This guide will explain the concept of :ref:`derived_features`, which include both **derived action features** and **derived context\n",
    "features**. Derived features allow you extra control to create additional features based on existing features. This provides additional\n",
    "feature engineering flexibility. To follow along, you should be familiar with the following concepts:\n",

    "- :ref:`react`\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Derived Feature Codes\n",
    "^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n",
    "The way in which each derived feature is derived is determined by what is called a **derived feature code**.  This is a snippet of\n",
    "`Amalgam <https://github.com/howsoai/amalgam>`_ style code that determines how the derivation should be performed.  One such example\n",
    "of a derived feature code is:\n",
    "\n",
    ".. code-block::\n",
    "\n",
    "   (* #hours-per-week 0 52)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This would use the multiplication opcode (``*``) to derive a feature that is 52 times the ``\"hours-per-week\"`` feature for each case.\n",
    "For a full list of opcodes that are available for derived feature codes, refer to the `Amalgam Language Documentation <https://howsoai.github.io/amalgam/>`_.\n",
    "\n",
    ".. note::\n",
    "\n",
    "    When referencing feature values in a derived feature code (e.g., ``#hours-per-week 0``) the value returned is offset by the number\n",
    "    which follows the reference.  When not using a time-series Trainee, this value can only be 0.  If you are using a time-series Trainee,\n",
    "    however, this value can be larger which will then refer to that many cases previously in the time-series (e.g., ``#hours-per-week 1``\n",
    "    would refer to the previous case in a time-series, if it were part of a time-series).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How-To Guide\n",
    "------------\n",
    "For this guide, we will add a feature called ``\"hours-per-year\"`` to the ``Adult`` dataset.  This dataset already contains a feature\n",
    "called ``\"hours-per-week\"``, so the relationship between the feature we have and the feature we want is mathematical in nature, and\n",
    "so should not be broken when making predictions.  Adding derived features to a :class:`~Trainee` can be done either before or after\n",

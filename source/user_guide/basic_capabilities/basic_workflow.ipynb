    "Howso Engine is a generalized Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence platform that creates powerful decision-making models that are fully explainable, auditable, and editable. Howso Engine uses Instance-Based Machine Learning which stores instances, i.e., data points, in memory and makes predictions about new instances given their relationship to existing instances. This technology harnesses a fast spatial query system and information theory for performance and accuracy.\n",

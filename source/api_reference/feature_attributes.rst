Feature Attributes
==================

Feature attributes are the foundational data structure used to define features and their properties for the Howso Engine.
Feature attributes can be generated inferred automatically using :py:meth:`~howso.utilities.infer_feature_attributes`, but
users are encouraged to manually inspect the resulting attributes and make any necessary changes.

See the full definition of all feature attributes in the pages below.

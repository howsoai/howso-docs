Howso Engine™
==================

Whether you are an individual or a large enterprise, AI has likely already impacted your daily life. While AI has likely opened up many exciting new opportunities, you have probably 
heard stories of AI generating "hallucinations" and grossly biased predictions. Understandably, you might have a nagging suspicion that the AI available today cannot be trusted. 
And because this AI is inherently “black box”, you cannot understand, trust, or control why its decisions were made, the data it used, or its reliability.  

Enter **Howso™**. Howso is the result of years of research and innovation to solve the problem of trustworthy AI. 
Howso is rooted in instance-based learning (IBL), so all of its decisions are made directly from the data. Howso stores information in memory and makes predictions from the 
similarities and differences between data points, not an underlying black box model, leading to fully transparent decisions with perfect attribution back to the source data. 
Howso utilizes cutting edge advances in the fields of statistics, physics, game theory, and information theory to make IBL understandable, performant, versatile, and trustworthy. 

In the spirit of providing trustworthy AI to all, Howso has open sourced its **Engine™** platform. Engine enables you to... 

- Make accurate predictions and avoid hallucinations

- Perfectly cite the data used to make predictions

- Utilize state of the art interpretability tools to identify how your dataset influenced predictions

- Automatically perform a variety of data science tasks

- Identify and maintain integrity during adversarial attacks on your data

- And more!

**So, how can you use the Howso Engine™, to harness the power of AI without sacrificing understanding, trust, and control?** 

Our docs are purpose 
built to provide you the tools and resources to confidently implement Engine to make important, human-centric decisions. Join us and learn... how so?

Howso Engine |tmk|
==================

The **Howso Engine** |tmk| is a natively and fully explainable ML engine, serving as an alternative to black box AI
neural networks. Itâ€™s core features give users data exploration and machine learning capabilities through the creation
and use of Trainees that help users store, explore, and analyze the relationships in their data. **Howso** |tmk| leverages
an instance-based learning approach with strong ties to the `k-nearest neighbors algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm>`__
and `information theory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory>`__ to scale for real world applications.

=======================

Diveplane Reactor |tmk| is an instance based machine learning platform that creates powerful decision-making models
that are fully explainable, auditable, and editable. Reactor |tmk| offers rich explanations for its decisions,
demonstrating which training data were used to make particular decisions.

Reactor |tmk| models are uniquely flexible, with capabilities that include changing target features without re-training
the model, re-training and editing training data as often as required, and accurately filling in sparse data via an
impute functionality. By combining the features of Reactor |tmk|, users can analyze their data in ways not typically
achievable using other state-of-the-art AI and machine learning techniques.
